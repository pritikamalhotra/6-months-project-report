6-week-report
=============

This repository contains the Report for my six weeks training.
To use this:
First of all, install LaTeX by typing command in the terminal:
    sudo apt-get install texlive-full
After installing this, go to the directory 6-week-report through terminal and type:
    pdflatex report.tex
It will produce a pdf file named "report.pdf" in the current directory. Open that using this command:
    evince report.pdf
