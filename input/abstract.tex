This project discusses the Numerical Method analysis tool and Weboctave. Numerical Analysis tool consists of set of programs implemented in octave. For this, I explored numerical methods in engineering and science. After studying about the methods and the approach followed, I devised this tool which basically is collection of direct and iterative methods to solve problems of simultaneous and transcendental equations, matrices and ordinary differential equations. \\  

The increasing importance of numerical methods in applied sciences have led to enhanced demand to deal with techniques of numerical analysis. The reason for this is that numerical methods can give the solution to applied problems when ordinary analytical methods fail.\\

Futhermore, it deals with Weboctave which is web interface to use octave i.e. anyone can use this service and need not have octave installed on their systems and can use this service remotely.\\

Also, this project is completely open source and the entire code is available 
to the user as and when required. There is Complete developer's 
Documentation as well as User manual alongwith it that helps using it a lot easier.
