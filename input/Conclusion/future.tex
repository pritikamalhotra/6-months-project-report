\section{Future Scope}
Numerical Methods Analysis tool is a learning tool for students. At this point it contains different methods which solve simultanoeus, transcendental and matrix problems.
It has ten such programs whereas in future it can be developed into a more requirement fulfilling tool by adding more methods. Octave is open source altenative to MATLAB.
It provides for various mathematical and scientific functionalities and is being continuously improved by a wide community which is contributing for its development. Weboctave is web interface to octave. We can add more features like improving the login functionality by using LDAP.
